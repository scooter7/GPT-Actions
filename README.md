## Getting Started

### Run the project locally

Minimum requirements to run the project locally:
- Node.js v18
- Python3
- Supabase Account

**1. Frontend (Next.js)**

First, set up your environment variables. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env.local`:

```shell
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and add your Supabase project's **Publishable key (anon key)**.

Then, install dependencies and run the development server:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

**2. Backend (Flask - Optional)**

The Python server is separate and can be run if needed for custom backend logic.

```shell
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python webserver.py
```
